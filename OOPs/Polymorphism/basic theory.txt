// Polymorphism 

Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). 
With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. 
Precisely, Poly means ‘many’ and morphism means ‘forms’.   

Types of Polymorphism -->  
(1) --> compile time polymorphism  --> (i) function overloading  (ii) operator overloading  
(2) --> run time polymorphism
