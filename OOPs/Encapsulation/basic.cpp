// Encapsulation --> wrapping up data member and fucntions
// Encapsulation --> information hiding/data hiding
// Fully Encapsulated class --> all data memebesr --> private  // that means we can access this members in same class 
// we cannot access this members from different class 

/* Advantage of Encapsulation -->
1. Data hide  --> security increasing
2. If we want, we can make class "Read Only"
3. Code Resuabiluty
4. Encapsulated code is better for unit testing
