In the context of GitHub, "PR" stands for "Pull Request." A pull request is a feature provided by GitHub (and other version control systems) that enables developers to propose changes to a repository.

Here's how the process typically works:

Fork the Repository: If you want to contribute to a project hosted on GitHub, you first fork the repository. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

Create a Branch: In your forked repository, you create a new branch to work on your changes. This keeps your changes separate from the main branch of the original repository.

Make Changes: In your branch, you make the desired changes to the codebase. This could include adding new features, fixing bugs, or making improvements to existing code.

Commit Changes: Once you're done making changes, you commit them to your branch. A commit is a snapshot of the changes you've made to the codebase.

Push Changes to GitHub: After committing your changes locally, you push them to your forked repository on GitHub. This updates your branch with the changes you've made.

Create a Pull Request: Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to propose merging your changes into the original repository. In the pull request, you can provide details about the changes you've made and any relevant information for the maintainers of the original repository to review.

Review and Discuss: Other developers, including the maintainers of the original repository, can review your pull request, leave comments, and suggest changes. This allows for collaboration and feedback on your proposed changes.

Merge the Pull Request: If the maintainers of the original repository approve your changes, they can merge your pull request into the main branch of the repository. This incorporates your changes into the project, and they become part of the codebase.

Pull requests are a fundamental aspect of collaborative development on GitHub, enabling developers to contribute to open-source projects and work together to improve software projects. They provide a structured and transparent way for proposing, reviewing, and incorporating changes to a codebase.
