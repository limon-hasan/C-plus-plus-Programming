Space complexity  <------------------------------->

--> Memory Space
--> Big-O Notation

(1) - Auxiliary space : Space that you take to solve the problem
(2) - Input Space : Space that you take to store the input

If there is given an array  of size N, A[N]
Then, Space Complexity = O(N)

Or,
there is given two variables like a,b and I have to sum up them
so the process :--->

int a , b;
int c = a+b;   // Here, C is Auxiliary space
So, space complexity = O(3)  because, I take 3 variables.
But if i work on that two variables like, b = a+b; then the sace complexity will be like O(2)
